  abstract = {The origins of binding affinity and COX-2/COX-1 selectivity for analogues of celecoxib have been explored using an approach that combines docking with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. These inhibitors are COX-2-selective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that are of current interest because the gastrointestinal irritation they cause is reduced compared to that caused by traditional NSAIDs. We report a novel docking method, based on a combined Tabu and Monte Carlo protocol, that determines starting conformations for MC simulations. Using the docking-predicted starting conformations, relative changes in binding free energies were computed for methyl, ethyl, hydroxymethyl, hydroxyl, thiomethyl, methoxy, trifluoromethyl, chloro, fluoro, and unsubstituted derivatives with the MC free energy perturbation (FEP) method. The computed free energies are in good accord with IC50 values, and the structural information from the simulations can be used to explain the experimentally observed binding trends. In addition, the docking and FEP results have provided clarification of the binding conformation of the phenylsulfonamide moiety and the origin of COX-2/COX-1 selectivity. Namely, the COX-2 Val \$\textbackslash{}rightarrow\$ COX-1 Ile subtitution is accompanied by an unfavorable conformational shift of the phenylsulfonamide ring.},

  abstract = {Accurately predicting protein\textendash{}ligand binding affinities and binding modes is a major goal in computational chemistry, but even the prediction of ligand binding modes in proteins poses major challenges. Here, we focus on solving the binding mode prediction problem for rigid fragments. That is, we focus on computing the dominant placement, conformation, and orientations of a relatively rigid, fragment-like ligand in a receptor, and the populations of the multiple binding modes which may be relevant. This problem is important in its own right, but is even more timely given the recent success of alchemical free energy calculations. Alchemical calculations are increasingly used to predict binding free energies of ligands to receptors. However, the accuracy of these calculations is dependent on proper sampling of the relevant ligand binding modes. Unfortunately, ligand binding modes may often be uncertain, hard to predict, and/or slow to interconvert on simulation time scales, so proper sampling with current techniques can require prohibitively long simulations. We need new methods which dramatically improve sampling of ligand binding modes. Here, we develop and apply a nonequilibrium candidate Monte Carlo (NCMC) method to improve sampling of ligand binding modes. In this technique, the ligand is rotated and subsequently allowed to relax in its new position through alchemical perturbation before accepting or rejecting the rotation and relaxation as a nonequilibrium Monte Carlo move. When applied to a T4 lysozyme model binding system, this NCMC method shows over 2 orders of magnitude improvement in binding mode sampling efficiency compared to a brute force molecular dynamics simulation. This is a first step toward applying this methodology to pharmaceutically relevant binding of fragments and, eventually, drug-like molecules. We are making this approach available via our new Binding modes of ligands using enhanced sampling (BLUES) package which is freely available on GitHub.},

  abstract = {Alchemical free energy simulations are amongst the most accurate techniques for the computation of the free energy changes associated with noncovalent protein\textendash{}ligand interactions. A procedure is presented to estimate the relative binding free energies of several ligands to the same protein target where multiple, low-energy configurational substates might coexist, as opposed to one unique structure. The contributions of all individual substates were estimated, explicitly, with the free energy perturbation method, and combined in a rigorous fashion to compute the overall relative binding free energies and dissociation constants. It is shown that, unless the most stable bound forms are known a priori, inaccurate results may be obtained if the contributions of multiple substates are ignored. The method was applied to study the complex formed between human catechol-O-methyltransferase and BIA 9-1067, a newly developed tight-binding inhibitor that is currently under clinical evaluation for the therapy of Parkinson's disease. Our results reveal an exceptionally high-binding affinity (Kd in subpicomolar range) and provide insightful clues on the interactions and mechanism of inhibition. The inhibitor is, itself, a slowly reacting substrate of the target enzyme and is released from the complex in the form of O-methylated product. By comparing the experimental catalytic rate (kcat) and the estimated dissociation rate (koff) constants of the enzyme-inhibitor complex, one can conclude that the observed inhibition potency (Ki) is primarily dependent on the catalytic rate constant of the inhibitor's O-methylation, rather than the rate constant of dissociation of the complex. \textcopyright{} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Accurate in silico prediction of protein\textendash{}ligand binding affinities has been a primary objective of structure-based drug design for decades due to the putative value it would bring to the drug discovery process. However, computational methods have historically failed to deliver value in real-world drug discovery applications due to a variety of scientific, technical, and practical challenges. Recently, a family of approaches commonly referred to as relative binding free energy (RBFE) calculations, which rely on physics-based molecular simulations and statistical mechanics, have shown promise in reliably generating accurate predictions in the context of drug discovery projects. This advance arises from accumulating developments in the underlying scientific methods (decades of research on force fields and sampling algorithms) coupled with vast increases in computational resources (graphics processing units and cloud infrastructures). Mounting evidence from retrospective validation studies, blind challenge predictions, and prospective applications suggests that RBFE simulations can now predict the affinity differences for congeneric ligands with sufficient accuracy and throughput to deliver considerable value in hit-to-lead and lead optimization efforts. Here, we present an overview of current RBFE implementations, highlighting recent advances and remaining challenges, along with examples that emphasize practical considerations for obtaining reliable RBFE results. We focus specifically on relative binding free energies because the calculations are less computationally intensive than absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculations and map directly onto the hit-to-lead and lead optimization processes, where the prediction of relative binding energies between a reference molecule and new ideas (virtual molecules) can be used to prioritize molecules for synthesis. We describe the critical aspects of running RBFE calculations, from both theoretical and applied perspectives, using a combination of retrospective literature examples and prospective studies from drug discovery projects. This work is intended to provide a contemporary overview of the scientific, technical, and practical issues associated with running relative binding free energy simulations, with a focus on real-world drug discovery applications. We offer guidelines for improving the accuracy of RBFE simulations, especially for challenging cases, and emphasize unresolved issues that could be improved by further research in the field.},

This process has been previously hindered by inaccurate force fields or energy equations and slow computational processors; however, improved software and hardware have made this goal much more attainable. Here we find that Schr{\"o}dinger's new FEP+, although still imperfect, proves more successful in predicting protein stability than other simpler methods of investigation.

Enhancements with respect to the previous version (OPLS2.1) include the addition of off-atom charge sites to represent halogen bonding and aryl nitrogen lone pairs as well as a complete refit of peptide dihedral parameters to better model the native structure of proteins. To adequately cover medicinal chemical space, OPLS3 employs over an order of magnitude more reference data and associated parameter types relative to other commonly used small molecule force fields (e.g., MMFF and OPLS\_2005). As a consequence, OPLS3 achieves a high level of accuracy across performance benchmarks that assess small molecule conformational propensities and solvation. The newly fitted peptide dihedrals lead to significant improvements in the representation of secondary structure elements in simulated peptides and native structure stability over a number of proteins. Together, the improvements made to both the small molecule and protein force field lead to a high level of accuracy in predicting protein\textendash{}ligand binding measured over a wide range of targets and ligands (less than 1 kcal/mol RMS error) representing a 30\% improvement over earlier variants of the OPLS force field.},

  abstract = {Molecular docking methodology explores the behavior of small molecules in the binding site of a target protein. As more protein structures are determined experimentally using X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, molecular docking is increasingly used as a tool in drug discovery. Docking against homology-modeled targets also becomes possible for proteins whose structures are not known. With the docking strategies, the druggability of the compounds and their specificity against a particular target can be calculated for further lead optimization processes. Molecular docking programs perform a search algorithm in which the conformation of the ligand is evaluated recursively until the convergence to the minimum energy is reached. Finally, an affinity scoring function, {$\Delta$}G [U total in kcal/mol], is employed to rank the candidate poses as the sum of the electrostatic and van der Waals energies. The driving forces for these specific interactions in biological systems aim toward complementarities between the shape and electrostatics of the binding site surfaces and the ligand or substrate.},

  issn = {1549-9618},
  abstract = {Bromodomains, protein domains involved in epigenetic regulation, are able to bind small molecules with high affinity. In the present study, we report free energy calculations for the binding of seven ligands to the first BRD4 bromodomain, using the attach-pull-release (APR) method to compute the reversible work of removing the ligands from the binding site and then allowing the protein to relax conformationally. We test three different water models, TIP3P, TIP4PEw, and SPC/E, as well as the GAFF and GAFF2 parameter sets for the ligands. Our simulations show that the apo crystal structure of BRD4 is only metastable, with a structural transition happening in the absence of the ligand typically after 20 ns of simulation. We compute the free energy change for this transition with a separate APR calculation on the free protein and include its contribution to the ligand binding free energies, which generally causes an underestimation of the affinities. By testing different water models and ligand parameters, we are also able to assess their influence in our results and determine which one produces the best agreement with the experimental data. Both free energies associated with the conformational change and ligand binding are affected by the choice of water model, with the two sets of ligand parameters affecting their binding free energies to a lesser degree. Across all six combinations of water model and ligand potential function, the Pearson correlation coefficients between calculated and experimental binding free energies range from 0.55 to 0.83, and the root-mean-square errors range from 1.4\textendash{}3.2 kcal/mol. The current protocol also yields encouraging preliminary results when used to assess the relative stability of ligand poses generated by docking or other methods, as illustrated for two different ligands. Our method takes advantage of the high performance provided by graphics processing units and can readily be applied to other ligands as well as other protein systems.},

Contemporary molecular simulation software such as AMBER, CHARMM, GROMACS, and SOMD include support for the method. Implementation details vary among those codes, but users expect reliability and reproducibility, i.e., for a given molecular model and set of force field parameters, comparable free energy differences should be obtained within statistical bounds regardless of the code used. Relative alchemical free energy (RAFE) simulation is increasingly used to support molecule discovery projects, yet the reproducibility of the methodology has been less well tested than its absolute counterpart. Here we present RAFE calculations of hydration free energies for a set of small organic molecules and demonstrate that free energies can be reproduced to within about 0.2 kcal/mol with the aforementioned codes. Absolute alchemical free energy simulations have been carried out as a reference. Achieving this level of reproducibility requires considerable attention to detail and package-specific simulation protocols, and no universally applicable protocol emerges. The benchmarks and protocols reported here should be useful for the community to validate new and future versions of software for free energy calculations.},

  abstract = {Recent improvements to free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations, especiallyFEP+, established their utility for pharmaceutical lead optimization. However, to dateFEP has typically been helpful only when (1) high-quality X-ray data is available and(2) the target protein does not undergo significant conformational changes.  Also, alack of systematic studies on determining an adequate sampling time is often one ofthe primary limitations of FEP calculations. Herein, we propose a modified versionof the FEP/REST (i.e., replica exchange with solute tempering) sampling protocol,based on systematic studies on several targets by probing a large number of permutations with different sampling schemes. Improved FEP+ binding affinity predictions for regular flexible-loop (F-loop) motions and considerable structural changes can be obtained by extending the pre-REST sampling time from 0.24 ns to 5 ns/{$\lambda$}and 2\texttimes{}10 ns/{$\lambda$}, respectively. We obtained much more precise {$\increment\increment$}G calculations of the individual perturbations, including the sign of the transformations and less error. We extended the REST simulations from 5 ns to 8 ns to achieve reasonable free energy convergence.Implementing REST to the entire ligand as opposed to solely the perturbed region, and also some important flexible protein residues (pREST region) in ligand binding domain (LBD) , also considerably improved the FEP+ results in most of the studied cases.  Preliminary molecular dynamics (MD) runs were useful for establishing the correct binding mode of the compounds and thus precise alignment for FEP+.},

  abstract = {Alchemical free energy (AFE) calculations based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are key tools in both improving our understanding of a wide variety of biological processes and accelerating the design and optimization of therapeutics for numerous diseases. Computing power and theory have, however, long been insufficient to enable AFE calculations to be routinely applied in early stage drug discovery. One of the major difficulties in performing AFE calculations is the length of time required for calculations to converge to an ensemble average. CPU implementations of MD-based free energy algorithms can effectively only reach tens of nanoseconds per day for systems on the order of 50,000 atoms, even running on massively parallel supercomputers. Therefore, converged free energy calculations on large numbers of potential lead compounds are often untenable, preventing researchers from gaining crucial insight into molecular recognition, potential druggability and other crucial areas of interest. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) can help address this. We present here a seamless GPU implementation, within the PMEMD module of the AMBER molecular dynamics package, of thermodynamic integration (TI) capable of reaching speeds of {$>$}140 ns/day for a 44,907-atom system, with accuracy equivalent to the existing CPU implementation in AMBER.

Accurate prediction of protein\textendash{}ligand binding free energies is therefore of central importance in computational chemistry and computer aided drug design. Multiple recent improvements in computing power, classical force field accuracy, enhanced sampling methods, and simulation setup have enabled accurate and reliable calculations of protein\textendash{}ligands binding free energies, and position free energy calculations to play a guiding role in small molecule drug discovery. In this Account, we outline the relevant methodological advances, including the REST2 (Replica Exchange with Solute Temperting) enhanced sampling, the incorporation of REST2 sampling with convential FEP (Free Energy Perturbation) through FEP/REST, the OPLS3 force field, and the advanced simulation setup that constitute our FEP+ approach, followed by the presentation of extensive comparisons with experiment, demonstrating sufficient accuracy in potency prediction (better than 1 kcal/mol) to substantially impact lead optimization campaigns. The limitations of the current FEP+ implementation and best practices in drug discovery applications are also discussed followed by the future methodology development plans to address those limitations. We then report results from a recent drug discovery project, in which several thousand FEP+ calculations were successfully deployed to simultaneously optimize potency, selectivity, and solubility, illustrating the power of the approach to solve challenging drug design problems.The capabilities of free energy calculations to accurately predict potency and selectivity have led to the advance of ongoing drug discovery projects, in challenging situations where alternative approaches would have great difficulties. The ability to effectively carry out projects evaluating tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands, of proposed drug candidates, is potentially transformative in enabling hard to drug targets to be attacked, and in facilitating the development of superior compounds, in various dimensions, for a wide range of targets. More effective integration of FEP+ calculations into the drug discovery process will ensure that the results are deployed in an optimal fashion for yielding the best possible compounds entering the clinic; this is where the greatest payoff is in the exploitation of computer driven design capabilities.A key conclusion from the work described is the surprisingly robust and accurate results that are attainable within the conventional classical simulation, fixed charge paradigm. No doubt there are individual cases that would benefit from a more sophisticated energy model or dynamical treatment, and properties other than protein\textendash{}ligand binding energies may be more sensitive to these approximations. We conclude that an inflection point in the ability of MD simulations to impact drug discovery has now been attained, due to the confluence of hardware and software development along with the formulation of ``good enough'' theoretical methods and models.},

  abstract = {Designing tight-binding ligands is a primary objective of small-molecule drug discovery. Over the past few decades, free-energy calculations have benefited from improved force fields and sampling algorithms, as well as the advent of low-cost parallel computing. However, it has proven to be challenging to reliably achieve the level of accuracy that would be needed to guide lead optimization ({$\sim$}5\texttimes{} in binding affinity) for a wide range of ligands and protein targets. Not surprisingly, widespread commercial application of free-energy simulations has been limited due to the lack of large-scale validation coupled with the technical challenges traditionally associated with running these types of calculations. Here, we report an approach that achieves an unprecedented level of accuracy across a broad range of target classes and ligands, with retrospective results encompassing 200 ligands and a wide variety of chemical perturbations, many of which involve significant changes in ligand chemical structures. In addition, we have applied the method in prospective drug discovery projects and found a significant improvement in the quality of the compounds synthesized that have been predicted to be potent. Compounds predicted to be potent by this approach have a substantial reduction in false positives relative to compounds synthesized on the basis of other computational or medicinal chemistry approaches. Furthermore, the results are consistent with those obtained from our retrospective studies, demonstrating the robustness and broad range of applicability of this approach, which can be used to drive decisions in lead optimization.},

The resulting molecules showed potencies in enzymatic BACE1 inhibition assays up to 1 nM. The correlation between the predicted activity from the FEP calculations and the experimental activity was good for the P3 pocket substituents. The average mean unsigned error (MUE) between prediction and experiment was 0.68 {$\pm$} 0.17 kcal/mol for the default 5 ns lambda window simulation time improving to 0.35 {$\pm$} 0.13 kcal/mol for 40 ns. FEP calculations for the P2{${'}$} pocket substituents on the same acylguanidine scaffold also showed good agreement with experiment and the results remained stable with repeated simulations and increased simulation time. It proved more difficult to use FEP calculations to study the scaffold modification from increasing 5 to 6 and 7 membered-rings. Although prediction and experiment were in agreement for short 2 ns simulations, as the simulation time increased the results diverged. This was improved by the use of a newly developed ``Core Hopping FEP+'' approach, which also showed improved stability in repeat calculations. The origins of these differences along with the value of repeat and longer simulation times are discussed. This work provides a further example of the use of FEP as a computational tool for molecular design.},

Alchemical free energy calculations seek to change that by providing rigorous binding free energies from molecular simulations. Given adequate sampling and an accurate enough force field, these techniques yield accurate free energy estimates. Recent innovations in alchemical techniques have sparked a resurgence of interest in these calculations. Still, many obstacles stand in the way of their routine application in a drug discovery context, including the one we focus on here, sampling. Sampling of binding modes poses a particular challenge as binding modes are often separated by large energy barriers, leading to slow transitions. Binding modes are difficult to predict, and in some cases multiple binding modes may contribute to binding. In view of these hurdles, we present a framework for dealing carefully with uncertainty in binding mode or conformation in the context of free energy calculations. With careful sampling, free energy techniques show considerable promise for aiding drug discovery.},

But these calculations are still difficult and tedious to analyze, and best practices for analysis are not well defined or propagated. Essentially, each group analyzing these calculations needs to decide how to conduct the analysis and, usually, develop its own analysis tools. Here, we review and recommend best practices for analysis yielding reliable free energies from molecular simulations. Additionally, we provide a Python tool, alchemical-analysis.py, freely available on GitHub as part of the pymbar package (located at http://github.com/choderalab/pymbar), that implements the analysis practices reviewed here for several reference simulation packages, which can be adapted to handle data from other packages. Both this review and the tool covers analysis of alchemical calculations generally, including free energy estimates via both thermodynamic integration and free energy perturbation-based estimators. Our Python tool also handles output from multiple types of free energy calculations, including expanded ensemble and Hamiltonian replica exchange, as well as standard fixed ensemble calculations. We also survey a range of statistical and graphical ways of assessing the quality of the data and free energy estimates, and provide prototypes of these in our tool. We hope this tool and discussion will serve as a foundation for more standardization of and agreement on best practices for analysis of free energy calculations.},

The second measure is based on information theory, and defines two relative entropies which are conveniently expressed in terms of the dissipated work for free-energy perturbation (FEP) calculations in the A\textrightarrowBA\textrightarrowB{$<$}math display="inline" overflow="scroll" altimg="eq-00015.gif"{$><$}mrow{$><$}mi{$>$}A{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo{$>\rightarrow{}<$}/mo{$><$}mi{$>$}B{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$} and B\textrightarrowAB\textrightarrowA{$<$}math display="inline" overflow="scroll" altimg="eq-00016.gif"{$><$}mrow{$><$}mi{$>$}B{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo{$>\rightarrow{}<$}/mo{$><$}mi{$>$}A{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$} directions, respectively. Phase-space overlap is an important consideration in the performance of free-energy calculations. To demonstrate this connection, we examine bias in FEP calculations applied to a system of independent particles in a harmonic potential. Systems are selected to represent a range of overlap situations, including extreme subset, subset, partial overlap, and nonoverlap. The magnitude and symmetry of the bias (A\textrightarrowBA\textrightarrowB{$<$}math display="inline" overflow="scroll" altimg="eq-00017.gif"{$><$}mrow{$><$}mi{$>$}A{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo{$>\rightarrow{}<$}/mo{$><$}mi{$>$}B{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$} vs B\textrightarrowAB\textrightarrowA{$<$}math display="inline" overflow="scroll" altimg="eq-00018.gif"{$><$}mrow{$><$}mi{$>$}B{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo{$>\rightarrow{}<$}/mo{$><$}mi{$>$}A{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$}) are shown to correlate well with the overlap, and consequently with the overlap measures. The relative entropies are used to scale the amount of sampling to obtain a universal bias curve. This result leads to develop a simple heuristic that can be applied to determine whether a work-based free-energy measurement is free of bias. The heuristic is based in part on the measured free energy, but we argue that it is fail-safe inasmuch as any bias in the measurement will not promote a false indication of accuracy.},

  abstract = {We consider staged free-energy calculation methods in the context of phase-space overlap relations, and argue that the selection of work-based methods should be guided by consideration of the phase-space overlap of the systems of interest. Stages should always be constructed such that work is performed only into a system that has a phase-space subset relation with the starting system. Thus multiple stages are required if the systems of interest are not such that one forms a phase-space subset with the other. Three two-stage methods are possible, termed umbrella sampling, overlap sampling, and funnel sampling. The last is appropriate for cases in which the subset relation holds, but only in the extreme, meaning that one system's important phase space constitutes a very small portion of the others. Umbrella sampling is most suitable for nonoverlap systems, and overlap sampling is appropriate for systems exhibiting partial phase-space overlap. We review recently introduced metrics that characterize phase-space overlap, showing that the performance of the single- and two-stage methods is consistent with the phase-space picture. We also demonstrate that a recently introduced bias-detection measure is effective in identifying inaccuracy in single- and multistage calculations. The examples used are the chemical-potential calculation for a Lennard-Jones liquid at moderate and at high densities, the same for model water at ambient conditions, and a process of charging a neutral ion in water.},

The rapid and accurate quantification of the strength of these interactions (as measured by binding affinity) is a grand challenge of computational chemistry, surmounting which could revolutionize drug design and provide the platform for patient-specific medicine. Recent evidence suggests that molecular dynamics (MD) can achieve useful predictive accuracy ({$<$} 1 kcal/mol). For this predictive accuracy to impact clinical decision making, binding free energy computational campaigns must provide results rapidly and without loss of accuracy. This demands advances in algorithms, scalable software systems, and efficient utilization of supercomputing resources. We introduce a framework called HTBAC, designed to support accurate and scalable drug binding affinity calculations, while marshaling large simulation campaigns. We show that HTBAC supports the specification and execution of free-energy protocols at scale. This paper makes three main contributions: (1) shows the importance of adaptive execution for ensemble-based free energy protocols to improve binding affinity accuracy; (2) presents and characterizes HTBAC -- a software system that enables the scalable and adaptive execution of binding affinity protocols at scale; and (3) for a widely used free-energy protocol (TIES), shows improvements in the accuracy of simulations for a fixed amount of resource, or reduced resource consumption for a fixed accuracy as a consequence of adaptive execution.},

  abstract = {A new method is proposed to calculate alchemical free-energy differences based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, called the conveyor belt thermodynamic integration (CBTI) scheme. As in thermodynamic integration (TI), K replicas of the system are simulated at different values of the alchemical coupling parameter {$\lambda$}. The number K is taken to be even, and the replicas are equally spaced on a forward-turn-backward-turn path, akin to a conveyor belt (CB) between the two physical end-states; and as in {$\lambda$}-dynamics ({$\lambda$}D), the {$\lambda$}-values associated with the individual systems evolve in time along the simulation. However, they do so in a concerted fashion, determined by the evolution of a single dynamical variable {$\Lambda$} of period 2{$\pi$} controlling the advance of the entire CB. Thus, a change of {$\Lambda$} is always associated with K/2 equispaced replicas moving forward and K/2 equispaced replicas moving backward along {$\lambda$}. As a result, the effective free-energy profile of the replica system along {$\Lambda$} is periodic of period 2{$\pi$}K\textendash{}1, and the magnitude of its variations decreases rapidly upon increasing K, at least as K\textendash{}1 in the limit of large K. When a sufficient number of replicas is used, these variations become small, which enables a complete and quasi-homogeneous coverage of the {$\lambda$}-range by the replica system, without application of any biasing potential. If desired, a memory-based biasing potential can still be added to further homogenize the sampling, the preoptimization of which is computationally inexpensive. The final free-energy profile along {$\lambda$} is calculated similarly to TI, by binning of the Hamiltonian {$\lambda$}-derivative as a function of {$\lambda$} considering all replicas simultaneously, followed by quadrature integration. The associated quadrature error can be kept very low owing to the continuous and quasi-homogeneous {$\lambda$}-sampling. The CBTI scheme can be viewed as a continuous/deterministic/dynamical analog of the Hamiltonian replica-exchange/permutation (HRE/HRP) schemes or as a correlated multiple-replica analog of the {$\lambda$}D or {$\lambda$}-local elevation umbrella sampling ({$\lambda$}-LEUS) schemes. Compared to TI, it shares the advantage of the latter schemes in terms of enhanced orthogonal sampling, i.e. the availability of variable-{$\lambda$} paths to circumvent conformational barriers present at specific {$\lambda$}-values. Compared to HRE/HRP, it permits a deterministic and continuous sampling of the {$\lambda$}-range, is expected to be less sensitive to possible artifacts of the thermo- and barostating schemes, and bypasses the need to carefully preselect a {$\lambda$}-ladder and a swapping-attempt frequency. Compared to {$\lambda$}-LEUS, it eliminates (or drastically reduces) the dead time associated with the preoptimization of a biasing potential. The goal of this article is to provide the mathematical/physical formulation of the proposed CBTI scheme, along with an initial application of the method to the calculation of the hydration free energy of methanol.},

  abstract = {Bromodomains, protein domains involved in epigenetic regulation, are able to bind small molecules with high affinity. In the present study, we report free energy calculations for the binding of seven ligands to the first BRD4 bromodomain, using the attach-pull-release (APR) method to compute the reversible work of removing the ligands from the binding site and then allowing the protein to relax conformationally. We test three different water models, TIP3P, TIP4PEw, and SPC/E, as well as the GAFF and GAFF2 parameter sets for the ligands. Our simulations show that the apo crystal structure of BRD4 is only metastable, with a structural transition happening in the absence of the ligand typically after 20 ns of simulation. We compute the free energy change for this transition with a separate APR calculation on the free protein and include its contribution to the ligand binding free energies, which generally causes an underestimation of the affinities. By testing different water models and ligand parameters, we are also able to assess their influence in our results and determine which one produces the best agreement with the experimental data. Both free energies associated with the conformational change and ligand binding are affected by the choice of water model, with the two sets of ligand parameters affecting their binding free energies to a lesser degree. Across all six combinations of water model and ligand potential function, the Pearson correlation coefficients between calculated and experimental binding free energies range from 0.55 to 0.83, and the root-mean-square errors range from 1.4\textendash{}3.2 kcal/mol. The current protocol also yields encouraging preliminary results when used to assess the relative stability of ligand poses generated by docking or other methods, as illustrated for two different ligands. Our method takes advantage of the high performance provided by graphics processing units and can readily be applied to other ligands as well as other protein systems.},

We performed FEP calculations with two different software methods: Schr{\"o}dinger-Desmond FEP+ and GROMACS implementations. There was qualitative agreement in the results from the two methods, and quantitatively the error for one data set was identical, 1.43 kcal/mol, but FEP+ performed better in the second, with errors of 1.17 versus 1.90 kcal/mol. The results have far-reaching implications, suggesting well-implemented FEP calculations can have a major impact on computational drug design.},

A custom made hybrid topology may prove useful for a particular mutation of interest, however, a high throughput mutation analysis calls for a more general approach. In this work, we present an automated procedure to generate hybrid structures and topologies for the amino acid mutations in all commonly used force fields.

Here, we introduce lead optimization mapper, LOMAP, an automated algorithm to plan efficient relative free energy calculations between potential ligands within a substantial library of perhaps hundreds of compounds. In this approach, ligands are first grouped by structural similarity primarily based on the size of a (loosely defined) maximal common substructure, and then calculations are planned within and between sets of structurally related compounds. An emphasis is placed on ensuring that relative free energies can be obtained between any pair of compounds without combining the results of too many different relative free energy calculations (to avoid accumulation of error) and by providing some redundancy to allow for the possibility of error and consistency checking and provide some insight into when results can be expected to be unreliable.

This strategy is called ``similarity-based docking''. For this purpose, we develop the flexible alignment program fkcombu, which aligns the target molecule based on atomic correspondences with the reference molecule. The correspondences are obtained by the maximum common substructure (MCS) of 2D chemical structures, using our program kcombu. The prediction performance was evaluated using many target-reference pairs of superimposed ligand 3D structures on the same protein in the PDB, with different ranges of chemical similarity. The details of atomic correspondence largely affected the prediction success. We found that topologically constrained disconnected MCS (TD-MCS) with the simple element-based atomic classification provides the best prediction. The crashing potential energy with the receptor protein improved the performance. We also found that the RMSD between the predicted and correct target conformations significantly correlates with the chemical similarities between target-reference molecules. Generally speaking, if the reference and target compounds have more than 70\% chemical similarity, then the average RMSD of 3D conformations is {$<$}2.0 {\AA}. We compared the performance with a rigid-body molecular alignment program based on volume-overlap scores (ShaEP). Our MCS-based flexible alignment program performed better than the rigid-body alignment program, especially when the target and reference molecules were sufficiently similar.},

  abstract = {Accurate and reliable calculation of protein\textendash{}ligand binding free energy is of central importance in computational biophysics and structure-based drug design. Among the various methods to calculate protein\textendash{}ligand binding affinities, alchemical free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations performed by way of explicitly solvated molecular dynamics simulations (FEP/MD) provide a thermodynamically rigorous and complete description of the binding event and should in turn yield highly accurate predictions. Although the original theory of FEP was proposed more than 60 years ago, subsequent applications of FEP to compute protein\textendash{}ligand binding free energies in the context of drug discovery projects over much of that time period was sporadic and generally unsuccessful. This was mainly due to the limited accuracy of the available force fields, inadequate sampling of the protein\textendash{}ligand conformational space, complexity of simulation set up and analysis, and the large computational resources required to pursue such calculations. Over the past few years, there have been advances in computing power, classical force field accuracy, enhanced sampling algorithms, and simulation setup. This has led to newer FEP implementations such as the FEP+ technology developed by Schr{\"o}dinger Inc., which has enabled accurate and reliable calculations of protein\textendash{}ligand binding free energies and positioned free energy calculations to play a guiding role in small-molecule drug discovery. In this chapter, we outline the methodological advances in FEP+, including the OPLS3 force fields, the REST2 (Replica Exchange with Solute Tempering) enhanced sampling, the incorporation of REST2 sampling with conventional FEP (Free Energy Perturbation) through FEP/REST, and the advanced simulation setup and data analysis. The validation of FEP+ method in retrospective studies and the prospective applications in drug discovery projects are also discussed. We then present the recent extension of FEP+ method to handle challenging perturbations, including core-hopping transformations, macrocycle modifications, and reversible covalent inhibitor optimization. The limitations and pitfalls of the current FEP+ methodology and the best practices in real applications are also examined.},

Over the past few decades, free-energy calculations have benefited from improved force fields and sampling algorithms, as well as the advent of low-cost parallel computing. However, it has proven to be challenging to reliably achieve the level of accuracy that would be needed to guide lead optimization ({$\sim$}5\texttimes{} in binding affinity) for a wide range of ligands and protein targets. Not surprisingly, widespread commercial application of free-energy simulations has been limited due to the lack of large-scale validation coupled with the technical challenges traditionally associated with running these types of calculations. Here, we report an approach that achieves an unprecedented level of accuracy across a broad range of target classes and ligands, with retrospective results encompassing 200 ligands and a wide variety of chemical perturbations, many of which involve significant changes in ligand chemical structures. In addition, we have applied the method in prospective drug discovery projects and found a significant improvement in the quality of the compounds synthesized that have been predicted to be potent. Compounds predicted to be potent by this approach have a substantial reduction in false positives relative to compounds synthesized on the basis of other computational or medicinal chemistry approaches. Furthermore, the results are consistent with those obtained from our retrospective studies, demonstrating the robustness and broad range of applicability of this approach, which can be used to drive decisions in lead optimization.},

The calculated pairwise free energy difference is either directly adopted or transformed to absolute binding free energy for molecule rank ordering. We investigated, through both analytic derivations and simulations, how the selection of pairs in the experiment could impact the overall prediction precision. Our studies showed that (1) the estimated absolute binding free energy () derived from calculated pairwise differences ({$\Delta\Delta$}G) through weighted least squares fitting is more precise in prediction than the pairwise difference values when the number of pairs is more than the number of ligands and (2) prediction precision is influenced by both the total number of pairs and the specifically selected pairs, the latter being critically important when the number of calculated pairs is limited. Furthermore, we applied optimal experimental design in pair selection and found that the optimally selected pairs can outperform randomly selected pairs in prediction precision. In an illustrative example, we showed that, upon weighing ligand structure similarity into design optimization, the weighted optimal designs are more efficient than the literature reported designs.

This has contributed to uncertainty and controversy in certain areas. This article therefore reviews and extends the connections of some important computational methods with the underlying statistical thermodynamics. A derivation of the standard free energy of binding forms the basis of this review. This derivation should be useful in formulating novel computational methods for predicting binding affinities. It also permits several important points to be established. For example, it is found that the double-annihilation method of computing binding energy does not yield the standard free energy of binding, but can be modified to yield this quantity. The derivation also makes it possible to define clearly the changes in translational, rotational, configurational, and solvent entropy upon binding. It is argued that molecular mass has a negligible effect upon the standard free energy of binding for biomolecular systems, and that the cratic entropy defined by Gurney is not a useful concept. In addition, the use of continuum models of the solvent in binding calculations is reviewed, and a formalism is presented for incorporating a limited number of solvent molecules explicitly.},

  abstract = {A general methodology for calculating the equilibrium binding constant of a flexible ligand to a protein receptor is formulated on the basis of potentials of mean force. The overall process is decomposed into several stages that can be computed separately: the free ligand in the bulk is first restrained into the conformation it adopts in the bound state, position, and orientation by applying biasing potentials, then it is translated into the binding site, where it is released completely. The conformational restraining potential is based on the root-mean-square deviation of the peptide coordinates relative to its average conformation in the bound complex. Free energy contributions from each stage are calculated by means of free energy perturbation potential of mean force techniques by using appropriate order parameters. The present approach avoids the need to decouple the ligand from its surrounding (bulk solvent and receptor protein) as is traditionally performed in the double-decoupling scheme. It is believed that the present formulation will be particularly useful when the solvation free energy of the ligand is very large. As an application, the equilibrium binding constant of the phosphotyrosine peptide pYEEI to the Src homology 2 domain of human Lck has been calculated. The results are in good agreement with experimental values.},

The method, an extension of thermodynamic integration, treats the coupling parameter {$\lambda$} as a variable in an extended Hamiltonian formulation and propagates it with the physical coordinates. In the resulting generalized ensemble, the crossing of barriers in the physical space is enhanced. The free energy difference is determined by integrating the reversible work required to move {$\lambda$} from zero (corresponding to the initial state) to one (corresponding to the final state). Examples are presented to illustrate the method.},

  abstract = {Identification of chemical compounds with specific biological activities is an important step in both chemical biology and drug discovery. When the structure of the intended target is available, one approach is to use molecular docking programs to assess the chemical complementarity of small molecules with the target; such calculations provide a qualitative measure of affinity that can be used in virtual screening (VS) to rank order a list of compounds according to their potential to be active. rDock is a molecular docking program developed at Vernalis for high-throughput VS (HTVS) applications. Evolved from RiboDock, the program can be used against proteins and nucleic acids, is designed to be computationally very efficient and allows the user to incorporate additional constraints and information as a bias to guide docking. This article provides an overview of the program structure and features and compares rDock to two reference programs, AutoDock Vina (open source) and Schr{\"o}dinger's Glide (commercial). In terms of computational speed for VS, rDock is faster than Vina and comparable to Glide. For binding mode prediction, rDock and Vina are superior to Glide. The VS performance of rDock is significantly better than Vina, but inferior to Glide for most systems unless pharmacophore constraints are used; in that case rDock and Glide are of equal performance.

  abstract = {Unlike other methods for docking ligands to the rigid 3D structure of a known protein receptor, Glide approximates a complete systematic search of the conformational, orientational, and positional space of the docked ligand. In this search, an initial rough positioning and scoring phase that dramatically narrows the search space is followed by torsionally flexible energy optimization on an OPLS-AA nonbonded potential grid for a few hundred surviving candidate poses. The very best candidates are further refined via a Monte Carlo sampling of pose conformation; in some cases, this is crucial to obtaining an accurate docked pose. Selection of the best docked pose uses a model energy function that combines empirical and force-field-based terms. Docking accuracy is assessed by redocking ligands from 282 cocrystallized PDB complexes starting from conformationally optimized ligand geometries that bear no memory of the correctly docked pose. Errors in geometry for the top-ranked pose are less than 1 {\AA} in nearly half of the cases and are greater than 2 {\AA} in only about one-third of them. Comparisons to published data on rms deviations show that Glide is nearly twice as accurate as GOLD and more than twice as accurate as FlexX for ligands having up to 20 rotatable bonds. Glide is also found to be more accurate than the recently described Surflex method.},

  abstract = {A strategy in drug design is to consider enhancing the affinity of lead molecules with structural modifications that displace water molecules from a protein binding site. Because success of the approach is uncertain, clarification of the associated energetics was sought in cases where similar structural modifications yield qualitatively different outcomes. Specifically, free-energy perturbation calculations were carried out in the context of Monte Carlo statistical mechanics simulations to investigate ligand series that feature displacement of ordered water molecules in the binding sites of scytalone dehydratase, p38-{$\alpha$}MAP kinase, and EGFR kinase. The change in affinity for a ligand modification is found to correlate with the ease of displacement of the ordered water molecule. However, as in the EGFR example, the binding affinity may diminish if the free-energy increase due to the removal of the bound water molecule is not more than compensated by the additional interactions of the water-displacing moiety. For accurate computation of the effects of ligand modifications, a complete thermodynamic analysis is shown to be needed. It requires identification of the location of water molecules in the protein-ligand interface and evaluation of the free-energy changes associated with their removal and with the introduction of the ligand modification. Direct modification of the ligand in free-energy calculations is likely to trap the ordered molecule and provide misleading guidance for lead optimization.},

However, when water molecules form highly coupled hydrogen-bonding networks, there is, as yet, no method that can rigorously calculate the free energy to bind the entire network or assess the degree of cooperativity between waters. In this work, we report theoretical and methodological developments to the grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation technique. Central to our results is a rigorous equation that can be used to calculate efficiently the binding free energies of water networks of arbitrary size and complexity. Using a single set of simulations, our methods can locate waters, estimate their binding affinities, capture the cooperativity of the water network, and evaluate the hydration free energy of entire protein binding sites. Our techniques have been applied to multiple test systems and compare favorably to thermodynamic integration simulations and experimental data. The implications of these methods in drug design are discussed.},

  abstract = {Computational methods to calculate ligand binding affinities are increasing in popularity, due to improvements in simulation algorithms, computational resources, and easy-to-use software. However, issues can arise in relative ligand binding free energy simulations if the ligands considered have different active site water networks, as simulations are typically performed with a predetermined number of water molecules (fixed N ensembles) in preassigned locations. If an alchemical perturbation is attempted where the change should result in a different active site water network, the water molecules may not be able to adapt appropriately within the time scales of the simulations\textemdash{}particularly if the active site is occluded. By combining the grand canonical ensemble ({$\mu$}VT) to sample active site water molecules, with conventional alchemical free energy methods, the water network is able to dynamically adapt to the changing ligand. We refer to this approach as grand canonical alchemical perturbation (GCAP). In this work we demonstrate GCAP for two systems; Scytalone Dehydratase (SD) and Adenosine A2A receptor. For both systems, GCAP is shown to perform well at reproducing experimental binding affinities. Calculating the relative binding affinities with a na\i\"ve, conventional attempt to solvate the active site illustrates how poor results can be if proper consideration of water molecules in occluded pockets is neglected. GCAP results are shown to be consistent with time-consuming double decoupling simulations. In addition, by obtaining the free energy surface for ligand perturbations, as a function of both the free energy coupling parameter and water chemical potential, it is possible to directly deconvolute the binding energetics in terms of protein\textendash{}ligand direct interactions and protein binding site hydration.},

  abstract = {Small molecule distribution coefficients between immiscible nonaqueuous and aqueous phases\textemdash{}such as cyclohexane and water\textemdash{}measure the degree to which small molecules prefer one phase over another at a given pH. As distribution coefficients capture both thermodynamic effects (the free energy of transfer between phases) and chemical effects (protonation state and tautomer effects in aqueous solution), they provide an exacting test of the thermodynamic and chemical accuracy of physical models without the long correlation times inherent to the prediction of more complex properties of relevance to drug discovery, such as protein-ligand binding affinities. For the SAMPL5 challenge, we carried out a blind prediction exercise in which participants were tasked with the prediction of distribution coefficients to assess its potential as a new route for the evaluation and systematic improvement of predictive physical models. These measurements are typically performed for octanol-water, but we opted to utilize cyclohexane for the nonpolar phase. Cyclohexane was suggested to avoid issues with the high water content and persistent heterogeneous structure of water-saturated octanol phases, since it has greatly reduced water content and a homogeneous liquid structure. Using a modified shake-flask LC-MS/MS protocol, we collected cyclohexane/water distribution coefficients for a set of 53 druglike compounds at pH 7.4. These measurements were used as the basis for the SAMPL5 Distribution Coefficient Challenge, where 18 research groups predicted these measurements before the experimental values reported here were released. In this work, we describe the experimental protocol we utilized for measurement of cyclohexane-water distribution coefficients, report the measured data, propose a new bootstrap-based data analysis procedure to incorporate multiple sources of experimental error, and provide insights to help guide future iterations of this valuable exercise in predictive modeling.},

  abstract = {An effective hybrid single-dual-topology protocol is designed for the calculation of relative binding affinities of small ligands to a receptor. The protocol was developed as an extension of the NAMD molecular dynamics program, which exclusively supports a dual-topology framework for relative alchemical free-energy perturbation (FEP) calculations. In this protocol, the alchemical end states are represented as two separate molecules sharing a common substructure identified through maximum structural mapping. Within the substructure, an atom-to-atom correspondence is established, and each pair of corresponding atoms is holonomically constrained to share identical coordinates at all time throughout the simulation. The forces are projected and combined at each step for propagation. Following this formulation, a set of illustrative calculations of reliable experiment/simulation data, including relative solvation free energies of small molecules and relative binding affinities of drug compounds to proteins, are presented. To enhance sampling of the dual-topology region, the FEP calculations were carried out within a replica-exchange MD scheme supported by the multiple-copy algorithm module of NAMD, with periodically attempted swapping of the thermodynamic coupling parameter {$\lambda$} between neighboring states. The results are consistent with experiments and benchmarks reported in the literature, lending support to the validity of the current protocol. In summary, this hybrid single-dual-topology approach combines the conceptual simplicity of the dual-topology paradigm with the advantageous sampling efficiency of the single-topology approach, making it an ideal strategy for high-throughput in silico drug design.},

Here, we demonstrate how both of these classes of algorithms can be considered as special cases of Gibbs sampling within a Markov chain Monte Carlo framework. Gibbs sampling is a well-studied scheme in the field of statistical inference in which different random variables are alternately updated from conditional distributions. While the update of the conformational degrees of freedom by Metropolis Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics unavoidably generates correlated samples, we show how judicious updating of the thermodynamic state indices\textemdash{}corresponding to thermodynamic parameters such as temperature or alchemical coupling variables\textemdash{}can substantially increase mixing while still sampling from the desired distributions. We show how state update methods in common use can lead to suboptimal mixing, and present some simple, inexpensive alternatives that can increase mixing of the overall Markov chain, reducing simulation times necessary to obtain estimates of the desired precision. These improved schemes are demonstrated for several common applications, including an alchemical expanded ensemble simulation, parallel tempering, and multidimensional replica exchange umbrella sampling.},

GC3 was structured much like the prior challenges GC2015 and GC2. First, Stage 1 tested pose prediction and affinity ranking methods; then all available crystal structures were released, and Stage 2 tested only affinity rankings, now in the context of the available structures. Unique to GC3 was the addition of a Stage 1b self-docking subchallenge, in which the protein coordinates from all of the cocrystal structures used in the cross-docking challenge were released, and participants were asked to predict the pose of CatS ligands using these newly released structures. We provide an overview of the outcomes and discuss insights into trends and best-practices.},

  abstract = {The Drug Design Data Resource (D3R) ran Grand Challenge 2 (GC2) from September 2016 through February 2017. This challenge was based on a dataset of structures and affinities for the nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR), contributed by F. Hoffmann-La Roche. The dataset contained 102 IC50 values, spanning six orders of magnitude, and 36 high-resolution co-crystal structures with representatives of four major ligand classes. Strong global participation was evident, with 49 participants submitting 262 prediction submission packages in total. Procedurally, GC2 mimicked Grand Challenge 2015 (GC2015), with a Stage 1 subchallenge testing ligand pose prediction methods and ranking and scoring methods, and a Stage 2 subchallenge testing only ligand ranking and scoring methods after the release of all blinded co-crystal structures. Two smaller curated sets of 18 and 15 ligands were developed to test alchemical free energy methods. This overview summarizes all aspects of GC2, including the dataset details, challenge procedures, and participant results. We also consider implications for progress in the field, while highlighting methodological areas that merit continued development. Similar to GC2015, the outcome of GC2 underscores the pressing need for methods development in pose prediction, particularly for ligand scaffolds not currently represented in the Protein Data Bank (http://www.pdb.org), and in affinity ranking and scoring of bound ligands.},

  abstract = {Accurately predicting the binding affinities of small organic molecules to biological macromolecules can greatly accelerate drug discovery by reducing the number of compounds that must be synthesized to realize desired potency and selectivity goals. Unfortunately, the process of assessing the accuracy of current computational approaches to affinity prediction against binding data to biological macromolecules is frustrated by several challenges, such as slow conformational dynamics, multiple titratable groups, and the lack of high-quality blinded datasets. Over the last several SAMPL blind challenge exercises, host\textendash{}guest systems have emerged as a practical and effective way to circumvent these challenges in assessing the predictive performance of current-generation quantitative modeling tools, while still providing systems capable of possessing tight binding affinities. Here, we present an overview of the SAMPL6 host\textendash{}guest binding affinity prediction challenge, which featured three supramolecular hosts: octa-acid (OA), the closely related tetra-endo-methyl-octa-acid (TEMOA), and cucurbit[8]uril (CB8), along with 21 small organic guest molecules. A total of 119 entries were received from ten participating groups employing a variety of methods that spanned from electronic structure and movable type calculations in implicit solvent to alchemical and potential of mean force strategies using empirical force fields with explicit solvent models. While empirical models tended to obtain better performance than first-principle methods, it was not possible to identify a single approach that consistently provided superior results across all host\textendash{}guest systems and statistical metrics. Moreover, the accuracy of the methodologies generally displayed a substantial dependence on the system considered, emphasizing the need for host diversity in blind evaluations. Several entries exploited previous experimental measurements of similar host\textendash{}guest systems in an effort to improve their physical-based predictions via some manner of rudimentary machine learning; while this strategy succeeded in reducing systematic errors, it did not correspond to an improvement in statistical correlation. Comparison to previous rounds of the host\textendash{}guest binding free energy challenge highlights an overall improvement in the correlation obtained by the affinity predictions for OA and TEMOA systems, but a surprising lack of improvement regarding root mean square error over the past several challenge rounds. The data suggests that further refinement of force field parameters, as well as improved treatment of chemical effects (e.g., buffer salt conditions, protonation states), may be required to further enhance predictive accuracy.},

  abstract = {The ability to computationally predict protein-small molecule binding affinities with high accuracy would accelerate drug discovery and reduce its cost by eliminating rounds of trial-and-error synthesis and experimental evaluation of candidate ligands. As academic and industrial groups work toward this capability, there is an ongoing need for datasets that can be used to rigorously test new computational methods. Although protein\textendash{}ligand data are clearly important for this purpose, their size and complexity make it difficult to obtain well-converged results and to troubleshoot computational methods. Host\textendash{}guest systems offer a valuable alternative class of test cases, as they exemplify noncovalent molecular recognition but are far smaller and simpler. As a consequence, host\textendash{}guest systems have been part of the prior two rounds of SAMPL prediction exercises, and they also figure in the present SAMPL5 round. In addition to being blinded, and thus avoiding biases that may arise in retrospective studies, the SAMPL challenges have the merit of focusing multiple researchers on a common set of molecular systems, so that methods may be compared and ideas exchanged. The present paper provides an overview of the host\textendash{}guest component of SAMPL5, which centers on three different hosts, two octa-acids and a glycoluril-based molecular clip, and two different sets of guest molecules, in aqueous solution. A range of methods were applied, including electronic structure calculations with implicit solvent models; methods that combine empirical force fields with implicit solvent models; and explicit solvent free energy simulations. The most reliable methods tend to fall in the latter class, consistent with results in prior SAMPL rounds, but the level of accuracy is still below that sought for reliable computer-aided drug design. Advances in force field accuracy, modeling of protonation equilibria, electronic structure methods, and solvent models, hold promise for future improvements.},

  abstract = {Prospective validation of methods for computing binding affinities can help assess their predictive power and thus set reasonable expectations for their performance in drug design applications. Supramolecular host\textendash{}guest systems are excellent model systems for testing such affinity prediction methods, because their small size and limited conformational flexibility, relative to proteins, allows higher throughput and better numerical convergence. The SAMPL4 prediction challenge therefore included a series of host\textendash{}guest systems, based on two hosts, cucurbit[7]uril and octa-acid. Binding affinities in aqueous solution were measured experimentally for a total of 23 guest molecules. Participants submitted 35 sets of computational predictions for these host\textendash{}guest systems, based on methods ranging from simple docking, to extensive free energy simulations, to quantum mechanical calculations. Over half of the predictions provided better correlations with experiment than two simple null models, but most methods underperformed the null models in terms of root mean squared error and linear regression slope. Interestingly, the overall performance across all SAMPL4 submissions was similar to that for the prior SAMPL3 host\textendash{}guest challenge, although the experimentalists took steps to simplify the current challenge. While some methods performed fairly consistently across both hosts, no single approach emerged as consistent top performer, and the nonsystematic nature of the various submissions made it impossible to draw definitive conclusions regarding the best choices of energy models or sampling algorithms. Salt effects emerged as an issue in the calculation of absolute binding affinities of cucurbit[7]uril-guest systems, but were not expected to affect the relative affinities significantly. Useful directions for future rounds of the challenge might involve encouraging participants to carry out some calculations that replicate each others' studies, and to systematically explore parameter options.},

We computed relative binding free energies using graphics processing unit accelerated thermodynamic integration (GPU-TI) on a data set originally assembled by Schr{\"o}dinger, Inc. Using their GPU free energy code (FEP+) and the OPLS2.1 force field combined with the REST2 enhanced sampling approach, these authors obtained an overall MUE of 0.9 kcal/mol and an overall RMSD of 1.14 kcal/mol. In our study using GPU-TI from AMBER with the AMBER14SB/GAFF1.8 force field but without enhanced sampling, we obtained an overall MUE of 1.17 kcal/mol and an overall RMSD of 1.50 kcal/mol for the 330 perturbations contained in this data set. A more detailed analysis of our results suggested that the observed differences between the two studies arise from differences in sampling protocols along with differences in the force fields employed. Future work should address the problem of establishing benchmark quality results with robust statistical error bars obtained through multiple independent runs and enhanced sampling, which is possible with the GPU-accelerated features in AMBER.},

The recent development and validation of advanced free energy calculation methods represents a major step toward this goal. Accurately predicting the relative binding free energy changes of modifications to ligands is especially valuable in the field of fragment-based drug design, since fragment screens tend to deliver initial hits of low binding affinity that require multiple rounds of synthesis to gain the requisite potency for a project. In this study, we show that a free energy perturbation protocol, FEP+, which was previously validated on drug-like lead compounds, is suitable for the calculation of relative binding strengths of fragment-sized compounds as well. We study several pharmaceutically relevant targets with a total of more than 90 fragments and find that the FEP+ methodology, which uses explicit solvent molecular dynamics and physics-based scoring with no parameters adjusted, can accurately predict relative fragment binding affinities. The calculations afford R2-values on average greater than 0.5 compared to experimental data and RMS errors of ca. 1.1 kcal/mol overall, demonstrating significant improvements over the docking and MM-GBSA methods tested in this work and indicating that FEP+ has the requisite predictive power to impact fragment-based affinity optimization projects.},

Multiple recent advances including the development of greatly improved protein and ligand molecular mechanics force fields, more efficient enhanced sampling methods, and low-cost powerful GPU computing clusters have enabled accurate and reliable predictions of relative protein\textendash{}ligand binding free energies through the free energy perturbation (FEP) methods. However, the existing FEP methods can only be used to calculate the relative binding free energies for R-group modifications or single-atom modifications and cannot be used to efficiently evaluate scaffold hopping modifications to a lead molecule. Scaffold hopping or core hopping, a very common design strategy in drug discovery projects, is critical not only in the early stages of a discovery campaign where novel active matter must be identified but also in lead optimization where the resolution of a variety of ADME/Tox problems may require identification of a novel core structure. In this paper, we introduce a method that enables theoretically rigorous, yet computationally tractable, relative protein\textendash{}ligand binding free energy calculations to be pursued for scaffold hopping modifications. We apply the method to six pharmaceutically interesting cases where diverse types of scaffold hopping modifications were required to identify the drug molecules ultimately sent into the clinic. For these six diverse cases, the predicted binding affinities were in close agreement with experiment, demonstrating the wide applicability and the significant impact Core Hopping FEP may provide in drug discovery projects.},

Macrocyclization has been recognized as an effective way to restrict the conformational space of acyclic small molecule inhibitors with the hope of improving potency, selectivity, and metabolic stability. Because of their relatively larger size as compared to typical small molecule drugs and the complexity of the structures, efficient sampling of the accessible macrocycle conformational space and accurate prediction of their binding affinities to their target protein receptors poses a great challenge of central importance in computational macrocycle drug design. In this article, we present a novel method for relative binding free energy calculations between macrocycles with different ring sizes and between the macrocycles and their corresponding acyclic counterparts. We have applied the method to seven pharmaceutically interesting data sets taken from recent drug discovery projects including 33 macrocyclic ligands covering a diverse chemical space. The predicted binding free energies are in good agreement with experimental data with an overall root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.94 kcal/mol. This is to our knowledge the first time where the free energy of the macrocyclization of linear molecules has been directly calculated with rigorous physics-based free energy calculation methods, and we anticipate the outstanding accuracy demonstrated here across a broad range of target classes may have significant implications for macrocycle drug discovery.},

The challenges for both target datasets were conducted in two stages, with the first stage testing pose predictions and the capacity to rank compounds by affinity with minimal structural data; and the second stage testing methods for ranking compounds with knowledge of at least a subset of the ligand\textendash{}protein poses. An additional sub-challenge provided small groups of chemically similar HSP90 compounds amenable to alchemical calculations of relative binding free energy. Unlike previous blinded Challenges, we did not provide cognate receptors or receptors prepared with hydrogens and likewise did not require a specified crystal structure to be used for pose or affinity prediction in Stage 1. Given the freedom to select from over 200 crystal structures of HSP90 in the PDB, participants employed workflows that tested not only core docking and scoring technologies, but also methods for addressing water-mediated ligand\textendash{}protein interactions, binding pocket flexibility, and the optimal selection of protein structures for use in docking calculations.

We identify MBAR as the consistently best performing method, though other methods are frequently comparable in reliability and accuracy in many cases. We demonstrate that assumptions of Gaussian distributed errors in free energies are usually valid for most methods studied. We demonstrate that bootstrap error estimation is a robust and useful technique for estimating statistical variance for all free energy methods studied.

This derivation of the acceptance ratio method, using a form of logistic regression, a common statistical technique, allows us to shed additional light on the underlying physical and statistical properties of the method. For example, we demonstrate that the acceptance ratio method yields the lowest variance for any estimator of the free energy which is unbiased in the limit of large numbers of measurements.},

  abstract = {Although calculations of free energy using molecular dynamics simulations have gained significant importance in the chemical and biochemical fields, they still remain quite computationally intensive. Furthermore, when using thermodynamic integration, numerical evaluation of the integral of the Hamiltonian with respect to the coupling parameter may introduce unwanted errors in the free energy. In this paper, we compare the performance of two numerical integration techniques-the trapezoidal and Simpson's rules and propose a new method, based on the analytic integration of physically based fitting functions that are able to accurately describe the behavior of the data. We develop and test our methodology by performing detailed studies on two prototype systems, hydrated methane and hydrated methanol, and treat Lennard-Jones and electrostatic contributions separately. We conclude that the widely used trapezoidal rule may introduce systematic errors in the calculation, but these errors are reduced if Simpson's rule is employed, at least for the electrostatic component. Furthermore, by fitting thermodynamic integration data, we are able to obtain precise free energy estimates using significantly fewer data points (5 intermediate states for the electrostatic component and 11 for the Lennard-Jones term), thus significantly decreasing the associated computational cost. Our method and improved protocol were successfully validated by computing the free energy of more complex systems hydration of 2-methylbutanol and of 4-nitrophenol-thus paving the way for widespread use in solvation free energy calculations of drug molecules.},

  title = {Reducing the Bias and Uncertainty of Free Energy Estimates by Using Regression to Fit Thermodynamic Integration Data.},
  volume = {30},
  issn = {01928651},
  abstract = {This report presents the application of polynomial regression for estimating free energy differences using thermodynamic integration data, i.e., slope of free energy with respect to the switching variable {$\lambda$}. We employ linear regression to construct a polynomial that optimally fits the thermodynamic integration data, and thus reduces the bias and uncertainty of the resulting free energy estimate. Two test systems with analytical solutions were used to verify the accuracy and precision of the approach. Our results suggest that use of regression with high degree of polynomials provides the most accurate free energy difference estimates, but often with slightly larger uncertainty, compared to commonly used quadrature techniques. High degree polynomials possess the flexibility to closely fit the thermodynamic integration data but are often sensitive to small changes in the data points. Thus, we also used Chebyshev nodes to guide in the selection of nonequidistant {$\lambda$} values for use in thermodynamic integration. We conclude that polynomial regression with nonequidistant {$\lambda$} values delivers the most accurate and precise free energy estimates for thermodynamic integration data for the systems considered here.

  title = {Appropriate Methods to Combine Forward and Reverse Free-Energy Perturbation Averages},
  volume = {118},
  abstract = {We consider the accuracy of several methods for combining forward and reverse free-energy perturbation averages for two systems (labeled 0 and 1). The practice of direct averaging of these measurements is argued as not reliable. Instead, methods are considered of the form beta(A(1)-A(0))=-ln[{$<$}w(u)exp(-betau/2){$>$}(0)/{$<$}w(u)exp( betau/2){$>$}(1)], where A is the free energy, beta=1/kT is the reciprocal temperature, u=U-1-U-0 is the difference in configurational energy, w(u) is a weighting function, and the angle brackets indicate an ensemble average performed on the system indicated by the subscript. Choices are considered in which w(u)=1 and 1/cosh[(u-C)/2]; the latter being Bennett's method where C is a parameter that can be selected arbitrarily, and may be used to optimize the precision of the calculation. We examine the methods in several applications: calculation of the pressure of a square-well fluid by perturbing the volume, the chemical potential of a high-density Lennard-Jones system, and the chemical potential of a model for water. We find that the approaches based on Bennett's method weighting are very effective at ensuring an accurate result (one in which the systematic error arising from inadequate sampling is less than the estimated confidence limits), and that even the selection w(u)=1 offers marked improvement over comparable methods. We suggest that Bennett's method is underappreciated, and the benefits it offers for improved precision and (especially) accuracy are substantial, and therefore it should be more widely used.

  abstract = {Accurate predictions of free energies of binding of ligands to proteins are challenging partly because of the nonadditivity of protein\textendash{}ligand interactions; i.e., the free energy of binding is the sum of numerous enthalpic and entropic contributions that cannot be separated into functional group contributions. In principle, molecular simulations methodologies that compute free energies of binding do capture nonadditivity of protein\textendash{}ligand interactions, but efficient protocols are necessary to compute well-converged free energies of binding that clearly resolve nonadditive effects. To this end, an efficient GPU-accelerated implementation of alchemical free energy calculations has been developed and applied to two congeneric series of ligands of the enzyme thrombin. The results show that accurate binding affinities are computed across the two congeneric series and positive coupling between nonpolar R1 substituents and a X = NH3+ substituent is reproduced, albeit with a weaker trend than experimentally observed. By contrast, a docking methodology completely fails to capture nonadditive effects. Further analysis shows that the nonadditive effects are partly due to variations in the strength of a hydrogen-bond between the X = NH3+ ligands family and thrombin residue Gly216. However, other partially compensating interactions occur across the entire binding site, and no single interaction dictates the magnitude of the nonadditive effects for all the analyzed protein\textendash{}ligand complexes.},

The power of structural biology is in translating knowledge of protein structures into insights about their forces, binding, and mechanisms. However, the complementary power of computer modeling is in showing ``the rest of the story'' (i.e., how motions and ensembles and alternative conformers and the entropies and forces that cannot be seen in single molecular structures also contribute to binding affinities). Upon binding to a protein, a ligand can bind in multiple orientations; the protein or ligand can be deformed by the binding event; waters, ions, or cofactors can have unexpected involvement; and conformational or solvation entropies can sometimes play large and otherwise unpredictable roles. Computer modeling is helping to elucidate these factors.},

The hypothesis is that compounds showing a similar field point pattern are likely to bind at the same target site regardless of structure. The methodology to test this idea is illustrated using HIV NNRTI and thrombin ligands and validated across seven other targets. From the in silico comparisons of field point overlays, the experimentally observed binding poses of these ligands in their respective sites can be reproduced from pairwise comparisons.},
